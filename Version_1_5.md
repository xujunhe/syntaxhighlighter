# Version 1.5 release notes #

Ever since release of 1.0 back in 2004 people constantly asked me to change `<textarea>` to `<pre>` and I have always avoided doing that because of the "poor" XML support inside `<pre>` tags. This is now a reality and both are supported. Please see [this page](PreAndTextarea.md) for more technical details on the issue.

In project related news, I have moved the whole thing on Google code and using [Google groups](http://groups.google.com/group/syntaxhighlighter?hl=en) for discussions and questions. From now on, please post all questions there. Any technical questions email directly to me will be ignored.

## What's new ##

  * Moved brush specific CSS code into brushes themselves
  * Fixed up Python brush
  * Supporting `<pre>` by default with legacy support for `<textarea>`
  * [Flash "copy to clipboard" function](Clipboard.md)
  * Reduced the size of the main CSS
